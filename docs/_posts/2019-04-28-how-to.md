# What do you need
- **sbt** installed: [https://www.scala-sbt.org](https://www.scala-sbt.org)
- **git** installed: [https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- **GitHub** account: [https://github.com/join](https://github.com/join)
- **GitHub Pages** project: [https://pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com)

# Let's start
## Create your project
The easiest way is just to clone this project:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pme123/github-pages-demo.git
```
Then just adjust/delete whatever you like, check:
- `_posts`
- `_config.yml`

## Prepare your develop environment
To develop you need 2 things:

1. Run the Jekyll server:
   ```bash
   cd docs
   bundle exec jekyll serve --baseurl ''
   ```
   This will also generate the site automatically whenever you change anything.
2. In another terminal start a `sbt-task`:
   ```bash
   sbt ~copyTask
   ```
   This recompiles the Scala code and copies to the Jekyll server whenever you change something in the `Scala` code.

## Push your changes to _GitHub_

> If you never have created a new _GitHub_ repo, please see [Using-Git-with-Terminal](https://github.com/codepath/ios_guides/wiki/Using-Git-with-Terminal#create-a-new-repository-on-github)

If you have the remote Repo and it is linked as described in the tutorial you can `commit` and `push` your project to _GitHub_. 

```bash
git commit -m "created my tutorial"
git push
```

After a while you see the result on _GitHub_: `https://[github-account].github.io/[github-repo]/`, for example [https://pme123.github.io/github-pages-demo/](https://pme123.github.io/github-pages-demo/)

# Add a Post / Blog

Create a page in the `_posts` directory. 
- The format must be `yyyy-MM-dd-some-name.md`
- For example: `2019-04-28-bio-tiger.md`

On the top of this page add a header with this format:

```yaml
---
title: "Title of your post"
excerpt: "An excerpt that is displayed as intro on the overview and as start of your blog."
categories:
  - Categorie of your post
tags:
  - tags of your blog
---
```
Here an example:
```yaml
---
title: "Tigers"
excerpt: "A small introduction on Tigers."
categories:
  - Animals
tags:
  - animal
  - biologie
  - tutorial

---
```

**Now start your Post / Blog** 
- you can use the standard _kramdown_ Markdown_, see https://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html 
- or checkout what the Jenkyll Theme provides: [So Simple](https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme)

> You can always check the result - just refresh [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)

# Adjust the navigation links
You can adjust the navigation on the top. Just adjust `_data/navigation.yml`  

Here we add this page:
```yaml
---
...

- title: How to
  url: /develop/2019/04/28/how-to

```

# Add a Graph
You can easily add a Graph in the form of \\(y=2+x^2\\).

In your Post add:
```yaml
<div id="plotHowTo"></div>
<script>plotGraph("x^3", "plotHowTo", -10, 10);</script>
```
- `plotGraph` is a _ScalaJS_ function (see `src/main/scala/pages/demo/Graph.scala`)

```scala
  @JSExportTopLevel("plotGraph")
  def plotly(
      exprStr: String, // the formula you want to draw a Graph for (in form of `x*2` - it mus contain a `x`)
      plotDiv: String, // the name of the `<div>` where you want to create the Graph.
      rangeFrom: Int = -20, // the range of the x-axe - minimum
      rangeTo: Int = 20 // the range of the x-axe - maximum
  )
``` 
This creates:
<div id="plotHowTo"></div>
<script>plotGraph("x^3", "plotHowTo", -10, 10);</script>

# Mathematical Expressions
We support [MathJax] to draw nice mathematical expressions.

You can do it inline, like \\(2 * \\pi * r = 2 * \\pi * 57.2 mm \\approx 359.4 mm\\) , or as a block. like: \\[2 * \\pi * r = 2 * \\pi * 57.2 mm \\approx 359.4 mm\\]

**Be sure you use `\\`!** 

Example in _Markup_:
```yml
Inline: \\(2 * \\pi * r = 2 * \\pi * 57.2 mm \\approx 359.4 mm\\)

Block: \\[2 * \\pi * r = 2 * \\pi * 57.2 mm \\approx 359.4 mm\\]
```
Example in _Scala_:
```scala
s"Inline: \\(r = \\sqrt{A/\\pi}\\)"

s"Block: \\[r = \\sqrt{A/\\pi}\\]"
``` 
# Code your own Graph
To draw Graphs or Diagrams we use [Plotly JS]. The [ScalaJS]-Facade is provided by [Scalably Typed].

As an example we want to draw a circle with a certain _radius_.

Lets create a `GraphExample.scala` in `src/main/scala/pages/demo`:

```scala
object GraphExample {
  
    @JSExportTopLevel("exampleGraph")
   def main(plotDiv: String, radius: Double): Unit = ???

}
```

The class has a method (name does not matter). What matters is the name of the `@JSExportTopLevel`.

In your Markup you can refer it then like:

```yaml
<div id="howToExampleGraph"></div>
<script>exampleGraph("howToExampleGraph", 5);</script>
```
The first line provides the `div` where the _Graph_ should be painted.
The second line calls the exported _Functionality_.

> Of course you could export the `object` and use it like `<script>GraphExample.exampleGraph("howToExampleGraph", 5);</script>`

If you have done that, you should see in the _Browser console_ a `NotImplementedError`.

So let's implement the _Graph_:

```scala
  @JSExportTopLevel("exampleGraph")
  def main(plotDiv: String, radius: Double): Unit = {

    val data: js.Array[Data] = js.Array() // we don't have data
    val layout: Partial[Layout] = 
      dynLit(
        xaxis = dynLit(
          zeroline = true,
          range = js.Array(- radius - 0.5, radius + 0.5)
        ),
        yaxis = dynLit(
          zeroline = true,
          range = js.Array(- radius - 0.5, radius + 0.5)
        ),
        width = 500,
        height = 500,
        shapes = js.Array( // the only shape is our circle
          dynLit(
            `type` = "circle",
            x0 = -radius,
            y0 = -radius,
            x1 = radius,
            y1 = radius
          )
        )
      ).asInstanceOf[Partial[Layout]] // Partial is not very nice done in the Facade

    Graph.plot(plotDiv, data, layout) // use the little helper to draw the Graph
  }
```
And that's how it should look like:

<div id="howToExampleGraph"></div>
<script>exampleGraph("howToExampleGraph", 5);</script>

That's it - make sure you check out **[Plotly JS]**, it is amazing what you can do.
