# What do you need
- **sbt** installed: [https://www.scala-sbt.org](https://www.scala-sbt.org)
- **git** installed: [https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- **GitHub** account: [https://github.com/join](https://github.com/join)
- **GitHub Pages** project: [https://pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com)

# Let's start
## Create your project
The easiest way is just to clone this project:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pme123/github-pages-demo.git
```
Then just adjust/delete whatever you like, check:
- `_posts`
- `_config.yml`

## Prepare your develop environment
To develop you need 2 things:

1. Run the Jekyll server:
   ```bash
   cd docs
   bundle exec jekyll serve --baseurl ''
   ```
   This will also generate the site automatically whenever you change anything.
2. In another terminal start a `sbt-task`:
   ```bash
   sbt ~copyTask
   ```
   This recompiles the Scala code and copies to the Jekyll server whenever you change something in the `Scala` code.

## Push your changes to _GitHub_

> If you never have created a new _GitHub_ repo, please see [Using-Git-with-Terminal](https://github.com/codepath/ios_guides/wiki/Using-Git-with-Terminal#create-a-new-repository-on-github)

If you have the remote Repo and it is linked as described in the tutorial you can `commit` and `push` your project to _GitHub_. 

```bash
git commit -m "created my tutorial"
git push
```

After a while you see the result on _GitHub_: `https://[github-account].github.io/[github-repo]/`, for example [https://pme123.github.io/github-pages-demo/](https://pme123.github.io/github-pages-demo/)

# Add a Post / Blog

Create a page in the `_posts` directory. 
- The format must be `yyyy-MM-dd-some-name.md`
- For example: `2019-04-28-bio-tiger.md`

On the top of this page add a header with this format:

```yaml
---
title: "Title of your post"
excerpt: "An excerpt that is displayed as intro on the overview and as start of your blog."
categories:
  - Categorie of your post
tags:
  - tags of your blog
---
```
Here an example:
```yaml
---
title: "Tigers"
excerpt: "A small introduction on Tigers."
categories:
  - Animals
tags:
  - animal
  - biologie
  - tutorial

---
```

**Now start your Post / Blog** 
- you can use the standard _kramdown_ Markdown_, see https://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html 
- or checkout what the Jenkyll Theme provides: [So Simple](https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme)

> You can always check the result - just refresh [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)

# Adjust the navigation links
You can adjust the navigation on the top. Just adjust `_data/navigation.yml`  

Here we add this page:
```yaml
---
...

- title: How to
  url: /develop/2019/04/28/how-to
---
```

# Add a Graph
You can easily add a Graph in the form of \\(y=2+x^2\\).

In your Post add:
```yaml
<div id="plotHowTo"></div>
<script>plotGraph("x^3", "plotHowTo", -10, 10);</script>
```
- `plotGraph` is a _ScalaJS_ function (see `src/main/scala/pages/demo/Graph.scala`)

```scala
  @JSExportTopLevel("plotGraph")
  def plotly(
      exprStr: String, // the formula you want to draw a Graph for (in form of `x*2` - it mus contain a `x`)
      plotDiv: String, // the name of the `<div>` where you want to create the Graph.
      rangeFrom: Int = -20, // the range of the x-axe - minimum
      rangeTo: Int = 20 // the range of the x-axe - maximum
  )
``` 
This creates:
<div id="plotHowTo"></div>
<script>plotGraph("x^3", "plotHowTo", -10, 10);</script>

# Mathematical Expressions
We support [MathJax]() to draw nice mathematical expressions.

You can do it inline, like \\(2 * \\pi * r = 2 * \\pi * 57.2 mm \\approx 359.4 mm\\) , or as a block. like: \\[2 * \\pi * r = 2 * \\pi * 57.2 mm \\approx 359.4 mm\\]

**Be sure you use `\\`!** 

Example in _Markup_:
```yml
Inline: \\(2 * \\pi * r = 2 * \\pi * 57.2 mm \\approx 359.4 mm\\)

Block: \\[2 * \\pi * r = 2 * \\pi * 57.2 mm \\approx 359.4 mm\\]
```
Example in _Scala_:
```scala
s"Inline: \\(r = \\sqrt{A/\\pi}\\)"

s"Block: \\[r = \\sqrt{A/\\pi}\\]"
``` 

# References

This project uses the following tools. All of them have excellent tutorials:
## Markup
- **Github Pages**: When you commit your project to _Github_ your pages will be created automatically. Check out https://pages.github.com 
- **Jekyll**: _Github Pages_ uses _Jekyll_ for rendering. See https://jekyllrb.com 
- **So Simple**: _Michael Rose_ creates great Themes for _Jekyll_ - so I choose _So Simple_ for this project. Check out its great tutorial: https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme
